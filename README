DMX Show system for Raider
==========================

Currently the system is based on 3 tools:
  dmxd
  jack2show
  show

dmxd - Handles Artnet data from DMX-Desk and filters the data before sending out via a ENTTEC USB DMX device.
       It also awaits commands from "show", like linear transformations, scaling existing Pearl DMX data, etc.

jack2udp - Awaits timecode data from Ardour (or any other jack compliant application), and sends it over UDP to "show".
xkeys2udp - Sends udp packets when a connected xkeys pad's keys are pressed or joged
show - Handles timecode data from "jack2udp", and fires DMX events to "dmxd" for the opening-show, taking over for the Pearl in this timeframe. "show" will via dmxd control which DMX channels that belongs to whom.
