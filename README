DMX Show system for Raider
==========================

Currently the system is based on 3 tools:
  dmxd
  jack2show
  show

dmxd - Handles DMX data from DMX-Desk (Pearl) and filters them before sending out via a ENTTEC USB DMX device.
       It also awaits commands from "show", like linear transformations, scaling existing Pearl DMX data, etc.

jack2show - Awaits timecode data from Ardour (or any other jack compliant application), and sends it over UDP to "show".

show - Handles timecode data from "jack2show", and fires DMX events to "dmxd" for the opening-show, taking over for the Pearl in this timeframe. "show" will via dmxd control which DMX channels that belongs to whom.
